### Short introduction of my site

This is a SPA (Single page Application) created using HTML, Bootstrap and CSS. <br>

## UX

My goal was to make it easy on eye (color wise) with less readable content as possible.
My portfolio website is easy to manage, it has four buttons in top right corner for easy navigation.
As it happens the most content can be found in works section. Nevertheless, I have tried to minimise reading time by inserting an images of my websites for eye catching purposes, when clicked on an image, it will open one of my projects in the new tab. In case someone is interested in source code, I have also included it just right after the images.
